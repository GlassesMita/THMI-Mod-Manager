# THMI Mod Manager - Home

Welcome to **THMI Mod Manager**! This is a mod management tool specifically designed for *Touhou Mystia Izakaya*.

## 🎮 Game File Verification

To ensure the mod manager works properly, we need to verify that game files are complete. The system will automatically check for the following files:

### Required Files
- **Touhou Mystia Izakaya.exe** - Main game executable file
- **UnityPlayer.dll** - Unity engine core library file

### File Status Indicators
- ✅ **Found** - File exists and is accessible
- ❌ **Missing** - File does not exist or is inaccessible

## 🔧 Development Mode

If you are a developer or performing testing work, you can enable **Development Mode** through the configuration file. In this mode:
- Skip game file integrity checks
- Display development mode notifications
- Allow operation without game files present

## 📁 File Location

Please ensure the mod manager is in the same directory as the game files:
```
Game Directory/
├── Touhou Mystia Izakaya.exe
├── UnityPlayer.dll
└── THMI Mod Manager.exe
```
